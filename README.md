-  Hai hai, my name's Vera (AKA Featherra)
- I'm studying software development, so since i'm still a student u won't see too much.
- I'd love to become a webdeveloper in the future, and i've started creating my own little projects to learn more beside school.
   (Whenever I have time that is)
- And yes that's my dog, his name is Duke 🔥
- That's all, thanks for stopping by 🎉
